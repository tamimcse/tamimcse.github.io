\cvsection{Projects}
\cvproject{Routing Table Lookup in Software and ASIC}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed Trie based routing table lookup algorithms in C and Linux Kernel. 
\item Evaluated the algorithms with routes from real core routers.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{C2RTL: A High-level Synthesis tool}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a high-level synthesis tool that can generate Verilog for pipelined ASIC from C code.
\item Implemented several routing table lookup and packet classification algorithms in C2RTL.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Router assisted congestion control}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed several router assisted congestion control such as XCP, RCP and NC-TCP in Linux kernel.
\item Evaluated the protocols using Mininet and a GStreamer based video streaming application. 
\end{itemize}
