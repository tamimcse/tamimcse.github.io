\vspace{3pt}
{\sl Graduate Assistant, Kent State University}\\
Kent, OH, USA (Sep, 2013 - present)
  
   \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
  \item Implemented several existing and new routing table lookup algorithms. Evaluated the algorithms with the routing tables from real core routers. Integrated the routing table lookup algorithms in Linux kernel (C).
  \item Developed a high-level synthesis tool that generates synthesizable Verilog from C code (C, Verilog).
  \item Generated the Verilog implementation of routing table lookup algorithms using high-level synthesis tools. Generated the physical chip layout from the Verilog using OpenROAD.
  \item Implemented router-assisted TCP such as RCP, XCP and NC-TCP in Linux kernel (C).  
  \item Developed a GStreamer based video streaming application (C).
  \item Developed several experimental network topologies using Mininet (Python).	
 \end{itemize}

{\sl Software Development Intern, inConatact} \\
Columbus, OH, USA (May, 2015 - Aug, 2015)
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Implemented a call dispatching mechanism of call centers where incoming calls are assigned to agents based on various criteria and skill metrics of the agents.(C\#)
	\item  Implemented an interval tree to make an call assignment efficient instead of searching all the agents.
  \end{itemize} \vspace{-6pt}

{\sl Software Development Intern, RightRez} \\
Bloomington, IN, USA (May, 2014 - Aug, 2014)
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	\item  Implemented a flight search (BFS and A* search) in a graph of 3 million flight routes (C\#)
	\item  Implemented several heuristics that reduced that searching time from 30 minutes to few seconds.
    \item  Integrated Sabre webservice to implement seat map for airlines. (C\#)
\end{itemize} \vspace{-6pt}

{\sl Senior Software Engineer, GenWeb2} \\
Dhaka, Bangladesh (Sep, 2012 - Jul, 2013)
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	\item  Implemented a 3D simulator of a CNC machine. (C++, OpenGL, Qt)
	\item  Calculated the minimum number of points to draw an arc based on the arc length. It reduced the CPU and memory consumption by almost 90\%
	\item Developed a backend of a mobile application that is used for charging electric cars. (Java, Postgresql) 
\end{itemize} \vspace{-6pt}
 
{\sl Software Engineer, KB Group} \\
Dhaka, Bangladesh (Apr, 2010 - Sep, 2011)
 \begin{itemize}
 \item  Implemented an end-to-end ticketing system for box offices. (C\#, SQL Server)
  \item  Integrated payment gateways to e-commerce and box office applications. (C++, COM, Classic ASP, SQL Server).
 \end{itemize} 
 
{\sl Software Engineer, Arista Enterprises}  \\
Dhaka, Bangladesh (Apr, 2009 - Mar, 2010)
\begin{itemize} 
\item  Implemented an end-to-end airline ticket booking system (C\#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, HTML, CSS, JavaScript). 
\end{itemize}  

{\sl Software Engineer, SDSL}  \\
Dhaka, Bangladesh (Feb, 2008 - Mar, 2009)
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a map navigator for feature phones and windows mobile with AfriGIS map. Worked on zooming, panning and caching of map tiles and data. (J2ME, C\#).
\end{itemize}
